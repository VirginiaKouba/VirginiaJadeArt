<h3> Testimonial </h3>
<p class="tiny"> "Working with Virginia was so easy and fun. She kept me in the loop through the entire process and made sure I liked the portraits of my dogs and that it fit their personality and styles. She has done two portraits for me of my personal animals and four portraits that I have given as gifts! Each time I have worked with Virginia she has responded promptly and has gotten my orders done in a very timely fashion. The portraits that were purchased as gifts were delivered without a hitch and were packaged nicely making it a great surprise!! Virginia makes the entire process an amazing experience and I will definitely be ordering from her again in the future!" - Kaydee (client) </p>
